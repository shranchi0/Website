            <div class="article-content">
                <p>Compliance is one of the largest and most labor-intensive functions inside regulated institutions. Regulatory frameworks are complex, can span over a thousand pages and are constantly changing with over 200 updates each day. Regulated institutions depend on large compliance and legal teams to manage this complexity manually. Not only is this process costly, slow, and painful, it increases the likelihood of errors, which in turn expose institutions to significant fines.</p>

                <p>Given its dependence on manual work and mountains of documentation, compliance is an industry LLMs are well suited to disrupt. At the same time compliance is too contextual, workflow dependent, and high-stakes to leave to generic AI tools. It requires purpose-built systems that deliver precision and accuracy from day one. This is why we are excited to announce our partnership with <a href="https://myriad.ai/">Myriad</a>, leading their seed round as they build AI agents that monitor, interpret, and automate compliance in heavily regulated industries, starting with financial services. Myriad continuously digests regulatory updates and turns them into company specific actions that its AI agents can execute reliably. This unlocks a new model of compliance: proactive, automated, and scalable.</p>

                <p>Myriad's cofounders, Ralf and Jan, first met during their Master's program at Georgia Tech. Ralf has a PhD in AI and has extensive experience leading teams at Google X and BMW before starting his prior company. Jan on the other hand has spent over a decade building large scale systems at Airbnb, Google and NVIDIA. In a field where precision, reliability, and trust are non-negotiable, they are exactly the kind of technical and ambitious founding team capable of bringing dependable AI to compliance.</p>

                <p>At Category, we often say our best investments "just click", we don't have to talk ourselves into the opportunity. Myriad is one of those. From our first conversation with Ralf and Jan, we knew that this was the team and vision we wanted to support.</p>

                <p>We are thrilled to welcome Myriad to the Category portfolio and help them bring AI agents to compliance across regulated industries.</p>
